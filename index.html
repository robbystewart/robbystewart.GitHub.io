		<p>My name is Robert Stewart and I am currently a Senior at Armstrong Jr-Sr High School. I was raised and still live in Worthington, Pennsylvania. My anticipated date of graduation from AHS is June 7th, 2018. Before graduation I would like to achieve distinguished Honor Roll and after graduation I would like to attend a trade or technical school for Computer Information Technology. I've had an interest in computers and other electronics ever since I was a kid that was  most likely sparked by my love for video games</p>
		<p>I'm creating this ePortfolio mainly to highlight my grades that I have received throughout my time in high school. I would also like to showcase my skills that I already do have and those that I hope to obtain in the future for anybody from possible employers, a school that I would like to apply to, or anyone who wants to know about my experiences. The things that I value are anything involving my education or skills and my previous work experiences at the Jerry Toy Farm and where I am currently employed, The Allegheny Mariner </p>
